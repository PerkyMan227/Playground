Now you need to implement:
In server/main.go:

Create a server struct that implements your gRPC service
Implement each RPC method (Join, Publish, ReceiveBroadcasts, Leave)
Manage connected clients
Handle Lamport timestamps
Broadcast messages to all clients

==== In client/main.go:  ==== 

Call Join when starting
Read user input for messages
Call Publish to send messages
Start a goroutine to receive broadcasts
Handle graceful shutdown (Leave)
