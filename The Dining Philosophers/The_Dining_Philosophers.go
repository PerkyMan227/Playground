/*
Explanation of Deadlock Prevention:

The system does not deadlock due to two primary mechanisms:

1.  **The Waiter Semaphore (Capacity of N-1):**
    The `waiter` channel acts as a semaphore, ensuring that at most `N-1` (where N=5 philosophers, so 4) philosophers can be in the "attempting to eat" state (i.e., trying to acquire forks) at any given time.
    *   **Why this prevents deadlock:** If all N philosophers could sit at the table and simultaneously pick up their first fork, they would each be holding one fork and waiting for another fork that is held by their neighbor. This creates a classic circular dependency, leading to a deadlock. By limiting the number of philosophers who can attempt to eat to N-1, we guarantee that at least one philosopher will always be able to pick up *both* forks.
    *   **How it works:** If 4 philosophers pick up their left forks, the 5th philosopher cannot proceed until one of the first 4 finishes eating and releases the `waiter` token. The 4 philosophers will attempt to pick up their right forks. Since there are only 4 active, there will always be at least one free right fork, allowing at least one philosopher to complete their meal, release both forks, and the `waiter` token. This breaks the cycle.

2.  **Asymmetric Fork Acquisition (Breaking Symmetry):**
    One philosopher (in this case, "Aristoteles" with ID 5) is programmed to pick up their forks in a different order than the others.
    *   **Normal philosophers (IDs 1-4):** Pick up the **LEFT** fork first, then the **RIGHT** fork.
    *   **Asymmetric philosopher (ID 5):** Picks up the **RIGHT** fork first, then the **LEFT** fork.
    *   **Why this prevents deadlock:** This strategy ensures that a circular wait condition, where every philosopher is holding their first fork and waiting for their second fork (which is held by the next philosopher in the circle), cannot form. By having one philosopher acquire the right fork first, they essentially create a "break" in the potential chain of dependency. If all others are waiting for their right fork (held by the next person), the asymmetric philosopher might be able to acquire their right fork because it's the "first" they're trying to get, and then their left. This strategy, combined with the waiter, provides robust deadlock prevention.
